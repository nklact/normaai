// Complex Serbian legal grammar parsing removed
// Now using simplified LLM-guided approach in api.rs for semantic legal document understanding

// This file previously contained:
// - SerbianLegalGrammarParser struct with regex patterns for Serbian legal references
// - Complex penalty amount parsing
// - Structured article classification 
// - Cross-reference extraction logic
//
// All of this functionality has been replaced with LLM-guided semantic search
// which is more flexible and handles natural language variations better
